# Travelingo

<p>
Often times world travelers struggle to communicate with people when exploring a new country where their language is not spoken. Travelingo is a site that allows adventurers to find businesses and people around the world that speak their same language. Meet a new friend, learn about the area, and have a conversation with a local to get an authentic experience of what it is like to live there. Now you can travel anywhere you want without language being a barrier!

If you speak a language that is not the common tongue in your area, sign up for Travelingo and meet people from around the world who also speak your language! Be an ambassador, make a friend, and help guide them to explore all that your community has to offer.

1) Select your language and locate the spots around your area where your language is spoken. 
2) Provide information about the individual spots. A short description of the location, a menu if its a restaurant, the employee/person who speaks that language, phone number of the business and address.
3) Allows other businesses/people to register for the site to be an ambassador for their community and meet people from foreign countries

MVP of the project is geolocating where the user is and showing them places around town based on language.
